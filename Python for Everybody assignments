#Write a program that uses a print statement to say 'hello world' .
print("hello world")

#print("123" + "abc")

#x = 42%10
 print(x)
 
#x = 15
 x = x + 5
 print(x)

#2.2 Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them. Note that input will pop up a dialog box.
Enter Sarah in the pop-up box when you are prompted so your output will match the desired output.

name = input("Enter your name")
print ("Hello", name)

#2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per
hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number.
Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.

hrs = float(input("Enter Hours:"))
rate = float(input("Enter Rate:"))
pay = hrs * rate
print("Pay:", float(pay))

#3.1 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay the hourly rate for the hours
up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the
program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry
about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly

hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
h = float(hrs)
rate = input("Enter rate:")
r = float(rate)
if h <= 40:
 	print( h  * r)
elif h > 40:
	print(40 * r + (h-40) * 1.5 * r)
