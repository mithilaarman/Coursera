#Write a program that uses a print statement to say 'hello world' .
print("hello world")

#print("123" + "abc")

#x = 42%10
 print(x)
 
#x = 15
 x = x + 5
 print(x)

#2.2 Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them. Note that input will pop up a dialog box.
Enter Sarah in the pop-up box when you are prompted so your output will match the desired output.

name = input("Enter your name")
print ("Hello", name)

#2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per
hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number.
Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.

hrs = float(input("Enter Hours:"))
rate = float(input("Enter Rate:"))
pay = hrs * rate
print("Pay:", float(pay))
